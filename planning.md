# Planet Domains
The aim is that this is a text game that multiple people can play.

## Client-Server model
Have a server with the game state, and allow interaction through rpc?
the rpc sends over the options that you have, and the client simply renders those options, allows you to pick them, sending back the response.

## Matchmaking
We can create rooms? Where people can play if they want.




## Card Playing
Each turn, the game should autoplay the cards that don't need the user to make a decision.
 * Adding combat, trade or authority
 * Drawing a card
 * Causing the opponent to discard a card
 * 

What are other abilities?
 * Triggered on having enough bases
 * Triggered when buying something (put next ship or base on top of deck)
 * Destroy an enemies base
